A silver goblet in the museum of Louvre. Underside of the object was unreachable for the visitors because the goblet stands on thick basement. But picture in the object description shows a full Flower of Life pattern in the bottom, very much similar to the silver goblet underside decoration in Stockholm. Unfortunately only very little is known about the Marlik culture, but artifacts found from the royal cemetery shows excellence in the gold and silver metalwork. Marlik, northern Iran, 1400–1100 BC.

### Ivory whorl

An [ivory whorl](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?assetId=94799&objectId=452251&partId=1) as seen in the British Museum. Cyprus, Greece, 1340 – 1050 BC. Note how peripheral petals are roughly made probably by a hand. This is a good example how precise much work it takes to draw the whole FOL pattern after the first seven simple circles.
