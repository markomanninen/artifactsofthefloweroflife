So now the question naturally arises, how does the nervous system know which connections to retain and which to eliminate? The work of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the 1970s (both of whom shared a Nobel prize with Sperry in 1981) provided the first clue. They conducted their ground-breaking experiments by closing the lid of one eye of newborn cats, and found that even one week without sight altered the connections of the eyes to layer 4 of the occipital cortex. Axons carrying nervous signals from the closed eye made fewer connections with the cortex, whereas axons from the open eye made many more connections than was normal. This suggested that visual system axons compete for space in the visual cortex, with the result of the competition dependent on the amount and type of sensory stimulation carried by the axons. Subsequent research by others using drugs to block the firing of visual system neurons, as well as artificial stimulation of these neurons, showed that it is not neural activity per se that results in the selective elimination of synapses, but rather that only certain types of neural activity result in the retention of certain synapses, while all others are eventually eliminated.

In a sense, then, cells that fire together wire together. The timing of the action-potential activity is critical in determining which synaptic connections are strengthened and which are weakened and eliminated. Under normal circumstances, vision itself acts to correlate the activity of neighboring retinal ganglion cells, because the cells receive inputs from the same parts of the visual world.[16]

Greenough's conception of how the adult brain is able to learn new skills and form new memories offers an appealing solution to the problem concerning the additive and subtractive processes underlying the adult's brain adaptation to new environments. According to this theory, experience-dependent learning combines both additive and subtractive processes. The additive component involves the blooming of new synapses in response to the animal's attempt to control aspects of a new, complex environment. Although the brain does appear to know what part of itself has to be involved in this new synapse-construction project, it need not (indeed, could not) know which particular connections to make. By forming a large variety and number of new connections, the brain can select the combinations that work best, in the same way that the immature, developing brain retains useful connections from its initial oversupply of synapses. The long-term result is an overall addition to the number of synapses. But the actual selection process that fine-tunes the connections is a subtractive one in which the useful connections are selectively retained and less useful ones eliminated. Although clear evidence exists for synaptic increase in learning, as I write this we still have no such evidence in mature learning for an overproduction of synapses that are then pruned away. However, recent research has found evidence for an overproduction of dendrites in mature rats during readaptation of the brain after brain injury, which at least suggests that synaptic overproduction may be involved as well.[34] These findings fit very nicely with the subtractive synapse findings on brain maturation and provide a solution to the mystery of how the brain could know exactly which new synaptic connections to establish to enable it to acquire new knowledge, skills, and memories.

In our pursuit of a naturalistic, nonmiraculous account of the knowledge that appears to be prior to sensory experience, we once again meet Konrad Lorenz, who, in addition to his important contribution to the understanding of the evolution of animal behavior, made an important contribution to epistemology. In a paper first published in 1941, he argued that the necessary a priori knowledge, including concepts of space, time, and causation, is actually the product of the biological evolution of the human nervous system.[18] As such, this knowledge does not result from the limited experience of an individual but rather is the hard-won product of the long and arduous evolution of our species. Thus Lorenz states that "all laws of `pure reason' are based on highly physical or mechanical structures of the human central nervous system which have developed through many eons like any other organ."[19]

Without merge, there would be no way to assemble the arbitrarily large, hierarchically structured objects with their specific interpretations in the language of thought that distinguish human language from other animal cognitive systems—just as Darwin insisted: “A complex train of thought can be no more carried out without the use of words, whether spoken or silent, than a long calculation without the use of figures or algebra” ([39], p. 88). With merge, however, the basic properties of human language emerge. Evolutionary analysis can thus be focused on this quite narrowly defined phenotypic property, merge itself, as the chief bridge between the ancestral and modern states for language. Since this change is relatively minor, it accords with what we know about the apparent rapidity of language's emergence.

These last genetic events most likely enhanced human cognitive and linguistic capabilities compared to Neanderthals, but they were the end point of a process extending over 500,000 years. When apes are raised in a setting in which language is used, they can acquire and use about 150 words to signal their wants and reflect on past events and assign new, metaphorical referents to these words. The Gardner chimpanzees used American Sign Language (ASL) and mastered elements of its inflectional morphology [17]. The bonobo Kanzi comprehended distinctions in meaning conveyed solely by syntax [18]. Any aspect of language that apes can master most likely was present in the common ancestor of humans and apes and surely was present in Neanderthals, ruling out a “protolanguage” that lacked syntax.

Art generally is accepted as a mark for human language. The archaeological record points to art being present in humans before the date for the appearance of language proposed by Bolhuis et al. [2]. The complex paint-making process carried out at the Blombos cave site in Africa, which involved simmering and stirring pigments and binders for extended periods, occurred 100,000 years ago [27]. This complex, labor-intensive enterprise would not have existed without earlier, simpler uses of red ochre and other pigments for ornamentation and painting [7]. Moreover, the presence or absence of art doesn’t tell us anything about the syntactic structure of a language. The Piraha people possess art, but their sentences, lacking embedded clauses [28], don’t conform to the minimalist definition of language proposed by Bolhuis et al. [2].
