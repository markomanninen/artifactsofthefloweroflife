# Theorizing the origins

The main goal of documenting and listing artifacts of the FOL is to become more aware of the historical origin of the symbol. That's why I'd like to theorize a little bit of the origin of the FOL first. After speculations I'm going to describe occurrences of the Flower of Life according to three time spans:

1. Early traces from 1500 BC to 200 BC
2. Beginning of the Common Era from 200 BC to 100 AD
3. Common Era until Middle Age from 100 AD to 1500 AD 

Then I will selectively list main occurrences of the FOL symbol accompanied by pictures.

More popular symbol from ancient times, the Cownose symbol, is crucial for understanding the FOL. It will give required historical and symbolical context to the FOL symbol. The Cownose symbol is a notable and a lot researched figure so I won't use time to list occurrences of it. I'm just going to pinpoint some research journals and books mentioning the Cownose.

Understanding the history of the Cownose will also help on dating issues with the FOL. Association between these two symbols is not recognized and understood enough in my opinion.
