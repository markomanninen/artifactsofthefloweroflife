# Theorizing the origins

Main goal of documenting and listing artifacts of the FOL is to become more aware of the historical origin of the symbol. That's why I'd like to theorize a little bit of the origin of the FOL first. After theorizing I will inclusively list all occurrences of the FOL symbol.

I think that the more popular symbol from ancient times, the Cownose symbol, is crucial to understand the FOL. It will give required historical and symbolical context to the FOL. The Cownose symbol is a notable and a lot researched figure so I won't use time to list occurrences of it. I'm just going to pinpoint some  research journals and books mentioning the Cownose.

Understanding the history of the Cownose will also help on dating issues with the FOL. Association between these two symbols is not noted enough in my opinion.
