# Conclusions

I think it is far too early to do any firm specific conclusions of the FOL symbol. Dating of the symbol is hard as it is usual when trying to trace ancient inventions. Often we can talk only in accuracy of thousands years, rather than hundreds even we speak of relatively new history. But it is clear that history of the FOL goes further than many expects. It makes sense that six petal rosette came first before the FOL preceding rhombus, triangle, hexagon and zig-zag patterns which themselves goes to the neolithic periods and beyond. But how long it took to develop from six rayed rosettes to the continuous flower pattern? We do need classifications to distinguish the development of the symbol from simple parts to the complex form. Different types of the pattern are visible on this essay althought time is not used to specify them accurately. This task belongs to the future work.

Other interesting questions are the development of the drafting compass, divider and caliper. These tools provided required accuracy to construct the FOL pattern. Quite often it is believed that Egyptians didn't possess the compass, that they were mere rope stretchers (see for example: L.R. Shelby: Medieval Masons' Tools, page 237). In contrast to this we can see oldest objects in the current survey coming from Egypt indeed! Anyone can make own conclusions if those egyptian cosmetic box lid carvings were made with a help of a rope/string or more accurate fixed or adjustable compass with sharp and durable endpoints. Museum object descriptions are pro to a compass. However following this line to get more information about the FOL is kind of a dead end because the history of the compass based on artifacts can be traced to the around 600 BC only. Are we thus forced to follow a more intuitive path and face the old Greek myth of [Perdix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdix_%28mythology%29), who was assumed to invent a pair of compasses and a saw? Legend tells that a zig-zag figured saw was made from the spine of a fish!

As it is with dating, it is with locating. Where did sophisticated sense of geometric forms develop to such a degree that the FOL was in ability of human mind ready to be manifested? We shouldn't forget that for example design of the [Samarra dishes](https://www.pinterest.com/markomanninen/samarra-geometry/) are truly amazing while they go as far as 7500 years back to the history.

What was the meaning of the FOL then? It is unlikely that the name and the meaning was carried out from millennium to millennium and through different cultures unchanged and same. Sometimes symbol was probably used as an interesting decoration and ornament, pleasing and exciting on the eye of an artisan, maybe without any specific profound meaning and name. Sometimes it appears clearly on a religious context. Later, when I'm struggling more with the mathematical and geometrical properties of the FOL as well as doing comparative mythical and etymological studies, I will present possible meanings and names attached to the symbol.
