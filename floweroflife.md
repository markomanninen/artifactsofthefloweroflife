# Flower of Life

The creation of the FOL symbol is started by drawing six intersecting circles around the seventh central circle. The FOL easier to draw than Cownose with a plain drafting compass (or divider) since you continue forming the pattern from simple and direct crossing points. In Cownose pattern you need to find perpendicular lines and right angles with more complicated procedure. This can be verified by doing both figures manually. Below is a computer generated version of the FOL pattern:
