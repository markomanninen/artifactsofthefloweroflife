# Reflections after the research journey

I made a six week self-funded research trip to Greece, Turkey, France and Sweden in summer 2014. Since that I have been systematically collecting pictures of artifacts of the Flower of Life. I will present inclusively 37 artifacts in this essay. All artifacts have the Flower of Life symbol printed, carved or other way presented on them.

Some websites already had a good collection of occurrences of the symbol at the moment of writing this (August 2014). However, my personal findings on archaeological sites and museums followed by exhausting research on the Internet has brought up new interesting occurrences of the Flower of Life. Artifacts of the Flower of Life in this form and scale are not collected anywhere else before, as far as I know.

Occurrence of the Flower of Life in Egypt was first reported by the New Age author Drunvalo Melchizedek in his lectures in 80's and 90's. Later the Flower of Life was officially presented in his two volume book "*The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life*" (1999-2000). Melchizedek first proclaimed the modern term **Flower of Life**. In his books the Flower of Life is described by the particular geometrical figure shown below:

In public the Flower of Life term is used more broadly to describe different formation phases of the symbol. I will also use term in more general way in this essay. I will use the Flower of Life term to denote the general pattern as well as different parts of the generation of the symbol.

Many topics surrounding the Flower of Life are highly controversial. This is due to Melchizedeks' background in the New Age philosophy. But that shouldn't limit people doing further research and finding the origin of the symbol.

[Flower of Life wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life) (in August 2014) states that one of the earliest occurrences of the Flower of Life is in the [Assyrian carpet stone](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Floor_decoration_from_the_palace_of_King_Ashurbanipal.jpg) dated at around 650 BC. The wiki page also questions the dating of the Flower of Life that is drawn on the Osirian temple stone in Abydos, Egypt. While dating of the Flower of Life in Abydos is debated, it is evident that the geometrical formation of the symbol was known already in 1600-1400 BC. From that time we have objects which show the same decoration motif. Objects are:

* [item 1](https://www.gitbook.com/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life/) from Mycenae, Greece
* [item 2](https://www.gitbook.com/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life/) from Thebes, Egypt
* [item 3](https://www.gitbook.com/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life/) from Marlik, Northern Iran
* [item 5](https://www.gitbook.com/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life/) from Cyprus

Note: the Flower of Life should not be confused with the [Fleur-de-lis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur-de-lis) or the [Tree of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life) symbols. I will call the Flower of Life later by the abbreviation FOL.
