# Cownose

Geometrical practice relating to intersecting circles have a long tradition. Practice can be seen from mathematical clay tablets available since Old Babylonian period (2000-1600 BC). 

Eleanor Robson shows the image of the concave square or so-called Apsamikku on her book "*[Mesopotamian mathematics](https://www.academia.edu/1261766/Mesopotamian_mathematics_page_proofs_)*". Simple depiction of the four petal rosette pattern in question is shown below:

Apsamikku is translated as *cownose* referring to the exterior shape of the [Stringray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cownose_ray#/media/File:Cownose_Rays.jpg) fish. Naming convention in the current geometric context is a little bit confusing. Cow-nose likeness of the fish comes from the lobes and a notched head of the Stringray. This is why the Stringray fish is also called the Cownose. The Apsamikku symbol doesn't look like the nose of the Cow. It looks like the peripheral shape of the Cownose fish.

[Ceremonial vessel](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ceremonial_Vessel_LACMA_AC1997.93.1.jpg) from Indus Valley civilization period (2600-2450 BC) and [other objects](http://www.pinterest.com/markomanninen/cows-nose/) from Harappa and Mohenjo-daro indicates that this particular symbol was known in the Indus Valley already in 3000 BC. According to Robson "*The apsamikku in Neo-Babylonian Mathematics*" (page 214) the Cownose design was known:

> ...from Halaf pottery of the sixth millennium BC to images of Neo-Assyrian textile in Syria...

It is probable that the Cownose pattern came somewhere from the ancient Fertile Crescent.

In the "*[Sound Holes And Geometrical Figures](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/physics/faculty/lawergren/repository/files/articles/Soundholes%20and%20Geometrical%20Figures.pdf)*" by Lawergren & Gurney, sound hole of a lyre or a harp is also called Apsamikkum. But shape of the hole resembles more an equilateral concave triangle than a square (ibid. Plate X). It could rather be that Apsamikkum generally refers to a hole, a window or a frame in the figure, not the exact shape of it. Determining the case is outside of the scope of the essay, but intriguing enough. If the FOL symbol/pattern had any particular name for ancients, I leave it for future speculations.
