# Cownose

Geometrical practice relating to intersecting circles have a long tradition. Practice can be seen from mathematical clay tablets available since Old Babylonian period (2000-1600 BC). 

Eleanor Robson shows the image of the four petal rosette or a concave square so-called Apsamikkum on her book "*[Mesopotamian mathematics](https://www.academia.edu/1261766/Mesopotamian_mathematics_page_proofs_)*". Simple depiction of the Cownose pattern is shown below:

Apsamikkum is often translated as a Cownose referring to the exterior shape of the Stringray fish. Naming convention in geometric context is confusing because cow-nose likeness comes from the lobes and a notched head of the Stringray fish. Apsamikkum can also be translated as a sound hole of the lyre according to [Lawergren & Gurney](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/physics/faculty/lawergren/repository/files/articles/Soundholes%20and%20Geometrical%20Figures.pdf).

But because design was known "from Halaf pottery of the sixth millennium BC to images of Neo-Assyrian textile" (The apsamikku in Neo-Babylonian Mathematics page 214) in the Syria, it is probable that Cownose pattern came somewhere from the ancient Fertile Crescent.
