Introduction
=======

In this essay I am going to present historical artifacts of the certain geometrical symbol that is known as the **Flower of Life** in contemporary history. Origin of the symbol dates back at least to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC in the ancient Mesopotamia. I've documented the usage of the symbol roughly from 1500 BC to 1500 AD.

The reader is expected to be familiar with basics of the [Flower of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life_(geometry) geometry. Elementary knowledge of the ancient Near East history and history of mathematics is helpful. Knowledge of visual arts, geometry and comparative religion studies are also useful.

I hope my independent research provides valuable resources for people to do further investigation with the topic.
