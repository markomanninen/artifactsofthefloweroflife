Artifacts of the Flower of Life
=======

In this essay I will present historical artifacts of the certain geometrical symbol that is known as the **Flower of Life** in contemporary history. Origin of the symbol dates back at least to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC in the ancient Mesopotamia. I have followed the usage of the symbol roughly from 1500 BC to 1500 AD.

The reader is expected to be familiar with basics of the [Flower of Life geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life_(geometry). Intermediate knowledge of the ancient Near East history and history of mathematics is helpful. Elementary knowledge of art, geometry and comparative religion studies are also useful.

I hope this independent research will provide key sources to do further research with the topic.
