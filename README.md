Artifacts of the Flower of Life
=======

In this essay I will present continuity of historical artifacts of the geometrical symbol 
that is known as the "Flower of Life" in modern day. Origins of the symbol dates at least 
to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia. Intermediate knowledge of the 
ancient Near East and western history of mathematics is required from the reader as well 
as elementary knowledge of art, geometry and religions. Reader is also expected to know 
basics of the Flower of Life geometry. I hope document will provide key sources for 
investigators willing to do further research with the topic.
