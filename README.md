Introduction
=======

In this essay, I am going to present historical artifacts of a certain geometrical symbol that is known in contemporary history as the **Flower of Life**. Origin of the symbol is in the ancient Mesopotamia and it dates back to the 2nd millennium BC or earlier. I have documented the usage of the symbol roughly from 1600 BC to 1600 AD.

The reader of this document is expected to be familiar with basics of the Flower of Life geometry<!-- cite author="wikipedia.org" title="Flower of Life geometry" date="" location="" type="website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_of_Life_(geometry)" -->. Elementary knowledge of the ancient Near East history and history of mathematics is helpful. Knowledge of visual arts, geometry, and comparative religion studies are also useful.

I hope my independent research provides a valuable resource for people to do further investigation in the topic.

An electronic book called Artifacts of the Flower of Life is published in four different formats: [Online](http://artifacts.flowerofliferesearch.com/), [PDF](http://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life), [EPUB](http://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life), and [MOBI](http://www.gitbook.com/download/mobi/book/markomanninen/artifacts-of-the-flower-of-life).
