# Credits

I have to credit all picture copyright holders and work made by numerous artists and authors. Without their work it is impossible to present the continuity of the FOL symbol by its various appearances in any satisfactory way.

Most of the pictures have been published with [Creative Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) license. It was straightforward to use those images on this essay. I have published all my own photos and illustrations with the same license. I believe it is the only way to keep creative work and research hassle free and enjoyable for everyone.

Items: 5, 6, 25, 26, 36 has restricted terms of use. I cannot present associated pictures directly on my essay, so I have just provided links to the original works.
