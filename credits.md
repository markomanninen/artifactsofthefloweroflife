# Credits

I have to credit all image copyright holders and work made by numerous artists and authors. Without their work it is impossible to present the continuity of the FOL symbol by its various appearances in any satisfactory way.

Most of the images have been published with [Creative Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) license. It was straightforward to use those images on this essay. I have published all my own photos and illustrations with the same license. I believe it is the only way to keep creative work and research hassle free and enjoyable for everyone.

Two items: 32 and 35 has untraceable sources. They have been used on the Internet widely without reference to the original work. I hope that someone who sees them here and knows the source will kindly contact me, so that I can attach credit line to the images. One of the advantages of the electronic publishing is to make new revisions and corrections in timely manner.

Items: 5, 6, 25, 26, 36 has restricted terms of use. I cannot present associated pictures directly on my essay, so I have provided links to the original works.
