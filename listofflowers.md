# List of artifacts

I have listed the following FOL artifacts in the order of time from the oldest to the newest and added undated items to the end of the list. I hope this list will help further investigators in finding out more details of the objects. The origin and history of the listed artifacts can reveal more about the history of the FOL itself.

On picture descriptions I'm going to tell shortly where these objects can be found, the dating of the objects and sometimes other additional notes, links and references. It is very probable that more objects with the FOL symbol attached on them will be found in the future. Think of approximately half a million clay tablets that have been excavated from the Near East so far. Reading, cataloging and interpreting them is still considered to be in its infancy. Many times more tablets are supposed to hide under the desert sands<!-- cite author="Bill T. Arnold" title="Who Were The Babylonians?" date="2005" location="page 13" type="book" href="#" -->. Same applies to treasures in Egypt. Maybe thousands of relating objects are in private collections around the world waiting to see the daylight some day in the future. Many museums don't have online picture collections of their objects yet but are constantly doing work to get information open for public.

Only when individuals and researchers have this particular subject on their mind, they may pay attention to the FOL geometry on artifacts. For example, the silver goblet (pic. [6.1.9](2000-0bc.md#fig6.1.9)) in the Medelhavsmuseet in Stockholm was found only when I realized, that the FOL can be seen from the bottom or the underside of the object. When I saw an attracting silver item in the museum glass vitrine, my first thing to do was to peek inside it. It was truly amazing to see the perfect FOL appearing there right under my eyes.
